# Don't Forget the Python

Don't Forget the Python is a command-line interface for [Remember the
Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com), an online-task management system.

Remember the Milk is very good at what it does - and is very easy to use in the
browser and various apps - so Don't Forget the Python will not focus on
duplicating its abilities, but will instead add a couple things that RTM
doesn't currently do, like exporting your lists and tasks to pdf. Don't Forget the
Python will also allow you to print your lists or tasks (by various attributes)
to the terminal.

Note the future tense - this is very much in development.

This CLI uses the Remember The Milk API but is not endorsed or certified
by Remember The Milk.
